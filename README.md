# Overview

This software was an intro to C++. I would eventually like to use more advanced libraries in the future but I wanted to start practicing the basics of loops, functions, classes and different data types before moving onto higher levels.

# Future Work

- Automatically generate the coordinates of the circle (really it's an oval) using math
- Learn to use OpenGL and other relavant graphics libraries
- With OpenGL update the animation to a rotating torus
